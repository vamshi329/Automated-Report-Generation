# Task-2: Automated Report Generation

## 📋 Task Description
Develop a script that reads data from a file, analyzes it, and generates a formatted PDF report using libraries like FPDF or ReportLab.

**Deliverables:**
- A Python script for automated report generation
- A sample PDF report

---

## 🚀 Solution Overview
This solution reads sales data from a CSV file, analyzes it to compute product-wise and total revenue, and generates a professional PDF report summarizing the results.

- **Script:** `generate_report.py`
- **Input Data:** `sales_data.csv`
- **Output Report:** `Sales_Performance_Report.pdf`

The script uses the `pandas` library for data analysis and the `FPDF` library for PDF generation.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas fpdf
   ```
2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python generate_report.py
   ```
   - The script will read `sales_data.csv` and generate `Sales_Performance_Report.pdf` in the same folder.

## 📈 What the Script Does
- Reads sales data from `sales_data.csv`
- Cleans and analyzes the data
- Calculates total revenue and product-wise sales
- Identifies the top-selling product
- Generates a formatted PDF report with:
  - Executive summary
  - Product-wise sales table
  - Header and footer on each page

---

## 📝 Notes
- Make sure `sales_data.csv` is present in the same folder as the script.
- The script will overwrite `Sales_Performance_Report.pdf` if it already exists.
- The screenshot file is not required for submission unless specifically requested.
